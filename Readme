README FILE:

Hello, welcome to my first project. In this project i implemented a basic-tic-tac-toe game that can be played by two players on Python.
These are the factors below that i considered when making this game. 

I want to now improve this project and create it an OOP Style with Classes, and explore if concepts like inheritence are possible. 

Making a tic-tac-toe game with python. 
Features and plans to add:
1. Create a game board that can be visually displayed in the console 
2. Take in player inputs from player a and b
3. Display input on game board
4. Create functions that will check for winners, losers or possible ties
5. Switch player
6. Check if the player won or lost or tie from his side
5. If no result occurs, continue playing or else announce winner or announce its a tie
6. Ask if they want to play again
